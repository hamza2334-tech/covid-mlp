## 🚀 Getting Started
Welcome to the covid-mlp project! This software predicts COVID-19 mortality rates using a shallow neural network built with CDC data. It is designed for users without a technical background, allowing you to harness machine learning for serious public health issues.

## 💻 System Requirements
Before you begin, ensure your system meets these requirements:
- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or newer, macOS Catalina or newer, or a modern Linux distribution.
- **RAM:** At least 4 GB is recommended.
